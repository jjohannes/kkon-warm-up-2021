== Working with your Gradle builds

== Gradle tasks

- Gradle knows inputs and outputs
- If output of a task is the input of another, there is a dependency
- Incremental - a task only executes if input/output changes
- Build cache - Outputs can be retrieved from (remote) cache

Demo #4

Exploring: task execution, incremental builds, build cache, custom tasks

== Custom tasks
// Example: class file counter

* An abstract class extending `DefaultTask`
* Written in Java, Scala, Groovy, Kotlin
* Properties as annotated abstract getter methods (`getPropertyName()`)
// ** `@InputFile`, `@InputFiles`, `@OutputFile`, `@OutputDirectory`
// ** Each task should have at least one input and one output
// ** Used for: task dependency, incremental builds, build cache
* Each task has an action implemented in a `@TaskAction` method
